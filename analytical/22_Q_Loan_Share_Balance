Problem Statement:
------------------
Write a query that returns the rate_type, loan_id, loan balance , and a column that shows with what percentage the loan's balance contributes to the total balance among the loans of the same rate type.

DataFrame: submissions
Expected Output Type: pandas.DataFrame

Sample Data:
------------
id	balance		interest_rate	rate_type	loan_id
1	5229.12		8.75		variable	2
2	12727.52	11.37		fixed		4
3	14996.58	8.25		fixed		9
4	21149		4.75		variable	7
5	14379		3.75		variable	5



Python Script: 
---------------
# Import your libraries
import pandas as pd

# Start writing code
submissions.head()
# print(submissions)

# Approach 1
results = submissions.groupby('rate_type')['balance'].sum().reset_index().rename(columns = {'balance':'total_balance'})

results = pd.merge(results, submissions, on = 'rate_type')
results['balance_share'] = results['balance']/ results['total_balance'] *100
results = results[['loan_id', 'rate_type','balance','balance_share']]

# Approach 2
# Create a column for cumsum and use it for calculating the contribution of loan's line item to total balance (cum sum percentage)

# submissions['type_sum'] = submissions.groupby(['rate_type']).agg({'balance':'sum'})
# submissions
# submissions['balance_share'] = (submissions['balance']/submissions['type_sum'])*100

# submissions = submissions[['rate_type','loan_id','balance','balance_share']]

--------------------------------

SQL Query:
---------
select * from submissions limit 5;


-- Window function over rate_type

SELECT rate_type, loan_id, balance, (balance/type_sum)*100 AS "loan_share"
FROM (SELECT *, SUM(balance) OVER(PARTITION BY rate_type) AS "type_sum"
        FROM submissions) temp ;

Window function in SQL
Python, merging a grouped by dataframe with its original dataframe to get the total of a rate type in the same row as the indiviudal row item.

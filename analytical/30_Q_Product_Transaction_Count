Problem Statement:
------------------
Find the number of transactions that occurred for each product. Output the product name along with the corresponding number of transactions and order records by the product id in ascending order. You can ignore products without transactions.

DataFrames: excel_sql_inventory_data, excel_sql_transaction_dataExpected Output Type: pandas.DataFrame


Solution:
----------

# Import your libraries
import pandas as pd

# Start writing code
excel_sql_inventory_data.head()
excel_sql_transaction_data.head()

# Group the transaction data by product_id and count the transactions
df_grouped = excel_sql_transaction_data.groupby('product_id').size().reset_index(name = 'transaction_count')

# inner join this with the inventory data
df_merged = df_grouped.merge(excel_sql_inventory_data, how = 'inner', on = 'product_id')[['product_name','transaction_count']]


Learnings:
----------
- .size() to count the number of unique counts in group by df

You’re given a table of Uber rides that contains the mileage and the purpose for the business expense.  You’re asked to find business purposes that generate the most miles driven for passengers that use Uber for their business transportation. Find the top 3 business purpose categories by total mileage.

DataFrame: my_uber_drivesExpected Output Type: pandas.DataFrame

Solution:
---------
# Import your libraries
import pandas as pd

# Start writing code
my_uber_drives.head()

# EDA
my_uber_drives.category.unique()

# find business purposes that generate the most miles driven for passengers that use Uber for their business transportation
 
# Step 1: Filter for business 
# Step 2:  groupby purpose, agg by sum of miles
# Step 3: nlargest 3 by total mileage

uber_df = my_uber_drives[my_uber_drives['category']=='Business'].groupby('purpose').agg({'miles':'sum'}).reset_index().nlargest(3, 'miles')

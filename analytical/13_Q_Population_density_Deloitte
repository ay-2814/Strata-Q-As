Problem Statement
-------------------
You are working on a data analysis project at Deloitte where you need to analyze a dataset containing information
about various cities. Your task is to calculate the population density of these cities, rounded to the nearest integer, and identify the cities with the minimum and maximum densities.
The population density should be calculated as (Population / Area).


The output should contain 'city', 'country', 'density'.

Table: cities_population

Sample Data:
-------------
city		country		population	area
Metropolis	Countryland	1000000		500
Smallville	Countryland	50000		1000
Coastcity	Oceanland	300000		0
Starcity	Mountainous	600000		600
Gotham		Islander	1500000		300



Python Script
---------------
# Import your libraries
import pandas as pd

# Start writing code
cities_population.head()


cities_population['city_density'] = cities_population['population']/cities_population['area']

# Keeping only non-zero values and convert and rounding to nearest integer
cities_population = cities_population[cities_population['city_density'].notnull()]
cities_population['city_density'] = cities_population['city_density'].round(0)

max_density = cities_population[cities_population['city_density'] == cities_population['city_density'].max()][['city','country','city_density']]

min_density = cities_population[cities_population['city_density'] == cities_population['city_density'].min()][['city','country','city_density']]

min_max_city_density = pd.concat([max_density, min_density])


SQL Query
--------------
with density AS(
    SELECT city, country, ROUND((population)/NULLIF(area, 0)) AS "city_density"
    FROM cities_population
    WHERE area > 0
),
max_density AS (
    select city, country, city_density
    FROM density
    WHERE city_density = (SELECT max(city_density) FROM density)
),
min_density AS (
    select city, country, city_density
    FROM density
    WHERE city_density = (SELECT min(city_density) FROM density)
)
SELECT * 
FROM max_density
UNION ALL
SELECT *
FROM min_density

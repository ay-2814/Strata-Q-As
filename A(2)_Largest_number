Find the largest number in an array.


Solution
---------
def find_largest_number(arr):
    """ 
    :type arr: List[int] 
    :rtype: int 
    """
    # Since its a list, its a sequence
    # Thus, its iterable, subscriptable and we can find its length
    largest = 0
    for num in arr:
        if num > largest:
            largest = num
    return largest

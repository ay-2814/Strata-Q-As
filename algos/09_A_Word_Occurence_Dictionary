Problem Statement:
-------------------
Given a list of sentences, construct a dictionary with all words and the number of their occurrences.

Constraints:
-------------
The input variable sentences is a list of strings.
The strings in sentences can contain any characters, including letters, numbers, and special characters.
The length of sentences can be any positive integer.
The length of each string in sentences can be any positive integer.
The words in each sentence are separated by spaces.
The words can contain any characters, including letters, numbers, and special characters.
The words are case-sensitive, meaning that "word" and "Word" would be considered as different words.
The number of occurrences of each word in the sentences can be any non-negative integer.

Solution in Python:
--------------------
# Attempt 1: Referenced from solution

def count_words(sentences):
    word_count = {}

    for sentence in sentences:
        # Split each sentence into different words on space
        # print(sentence)
        words = sentence.split()
        
        for word in words: 
            # Check if the word exists in the dictionary
            # If it does, update the counter
            if word in word_count:
                word_count[word] += 1
                # If it does not, add it to the list
            else:
                word_count[word] = 1
    return word_count

    print("type of sentences is: ", type(sentences)) # <class 'list'>

        # print(sentence)
        print("type of sentence is: ", type(sentence))  # <class 'str'>
        words = sentence.split() # can be used on str, not on lists
        # print(words)
        print("type of words is: ", type(words)) # <class 'list'>
        for word in words:
            if word in word_count:
                word_count[word] += 1

                word_count[word] = 1
    
    return word_count

Learnings:
----------
- naming list of sentences as sentences
- looping through the list to get one sentence and storing it in variable sentence
- initial input is a list
- when the list is looped through, the sentence is sentences is of type str
- on str, .split() can be applied
- .split() converts the str once again to a list, this time containing the words as a list
- to check if a key exists in a dictionary, we can used if element in dict:

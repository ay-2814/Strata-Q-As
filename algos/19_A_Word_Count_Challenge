Problem Statement:
------------------

Word Count Challenge

Count the number of words in a given sentence.

Constraints
The input variable sentence must be a string.


Solution:
----------
def count_words(sentence):
    """ 
    :type sentence: str
    :rtype: int 
    """
    word_list = (sentence.split()) # Split uses any whitespace (spaces, tabs, newlines) as a delimiter to split the string.
    print(word_list)
    return len(word_list)


Learnings:
----------
- # Split uses any whitespace (spaces, tabs, newlines) as a delimiter to split the string.
- if we run, for word in sentence:
		print(word)
this actually prints each letter(character) because in python, a string is an iterable of characters.

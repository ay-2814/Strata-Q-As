## Problem Statement ##

You have been asked to get a list of all the sign up IDs with transaction start dates in either April or May.


Since a sign up ID can be used for multiple transactions only output the unique ID.


Your output should contain a list of non duplicated sign-up IDs.

Table : transactions
Preview

transaction_id: int
signup_id: int
transaction_start_date: datetime
amt: float


SELECT * FROM transactions limit 5;

<Output

transaction_id	signup_id	transaction_start_date	amt
1	100	2020-04-30	24.9
2	101	2020-04-16	24.9
3	102	2020-04-28	9.9
4	102	2020-05-28	9.9

## SQL Query 

SELECT DISTINCT(transaction_id)
FROM transactions
WHERE EXTRACT(MONTH FROM transaction_start_date) in (4,5)


## Python script

# Import your libraries
import pandas as pd

# Start writing code
# transactions.head()

# Get datatype info using .info()
# transactions.info()

# Column that has only months extracted from date column
transactions['month'] = transactions['transaction_start_date'].dt.month

# transactions.head()

# filter transactions for April or May
# transactions = transactions[(transactions['month']==4) | (transactions['month']==5)]
# Can also do the multiple selection using isin
transactions = transactions[transactions['month'].isin([4,5])]

# transactions.head()

# Taking only the unique signup_id from this df
transactions = transactions['signup_id'].unique()

Problem Statement:
-------------------
As a data scientist at Amazon Prime Video, you are tasked with enhancing the in-flight entertainment experience for Amazonâ€™s airline partners. Your challenge is to develop a feature that suggests individual movies from Amazon's content database that fit within a given flight's duration. For flight 101, find movies whose runtime is less than or equal to the flight's duration.


The output should list suggested movies for the flight, including 'flight_id', 'movie_id', and 'movie_duration'."

DataFrames: entertainment_catalog, flight_schedule


Sample Data:
------------
flight_id	flight_duration	flight_date
101			240	2024-01-01 00:00:00
102			180	2024-01-02 00:00:00
103			240	2024-01-03 00:00:00
104			150	2024-01-04 00:00:00
105			300	2024-01-05 00:00:00


movie_id	title		duration
1	The Great Adventure	120
2	Space Journey		90
3	Ocean Mystery		60
4	The Lost City		150
5	Mountain Quest		110


Python Script:
----------------
# Import your libraries
import pandas as pd

#
flight_schedule.head()
entertainment_catalog.head()

flight_schedule.assign(key=1)

# create cross join to match each flight with each movie
flight_movie_merge_cross = pd.merge(flight_schedule.assign(key=1), entertainment_catalog.assign(key=1), on ='key').drop('key', axis = 1)


# Filtering movies where their duration is less than the corresponding flight's duration
movies_shorter_than_flight = flight_movie_merge_cross[flight_movie_merge_cross['flight_duration'] >= flight_movie_merge_cross['duration']]

# select required columns
movies_shorter_than_flight = movies_shorter_than_flight[['flight_id', 'movie_id', 'duration']]

# Filtering for required flight_id
req_flight_id = 101

flight_101_movies = movies_shorter_than_flight[movies_shorter_than_flight['flight_id'] == req_flight_id ]

SQL Query
--------

    select *, 1 AS "key"
    FROM flight_schedule
    ),

    select *, 1 AS "key"
    FROM entertainment_catalog
    ),

    select f.*, e.*
    FROM flight_key f
    CROSS JOIN entertainment_key e)
SELECT distinct flight_id, movie_id, duration

AND flight_id = 101;
